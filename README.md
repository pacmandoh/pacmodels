## 3D Models for [PacDocs](https://crybabyaq.love)
It's cool to add a 3D model to your own web personal project, but it also faces a memory leak caused by the 3D model, and the memory leak is a very painful thing for me, a rookie, and it can't be investigated at all. Looking at the document example of Three.js, I found that the force is embedded through `<iframe />`, so this 3D model project for iframe embedding was created by combining Nuxt and three.js. Furthermore, it serves as an exhibitor as well.

Similarly, you can also embed it in your personal website or web project through `<iframe />`:
```html
<iframe
  width="100%"
  height="100%"
  src="https://model.crybabyaq.love/?model=audiS8&button=false"
  title="Audi S8 V8 Engine"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope;"
  style="color-scheme: light;"
/>
```
