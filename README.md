## 3D Models for [PacDocs](https://crybabyaq.love)
It's cool to add a 3D model to your own web personal project, but it also faces a memory leak caused by the 3D model, and the memory leak is a very painful thing for me, a rookie, and it can't be investigated at all. Looking at the document example of Three.js, I found that the force is embedded through `<iframe />`, so this 3D model project for iframe embedding was created by combining Nuxt and three.js. Furthermore, it serves as an exhibitor as well.

## How to use üîß
You can select the models you want through routing parameters, whether to display the selection, full screen, and color mode buttons. Alternatively, you can consider using it as a showcase or a glTF viewer.

## examples üìÉ
You can view the model by visiting the website directly.
[https://model.crybabyaq.love/?model=AudiS8&nobutton](https://model.crybabyaq.love/?model=AudiS8&nobutton)

Similarly, you can also embed it in your personal website or web project through `<iframe />`:
```html
<iframe
  width="100%"
  height="100%"
  src="https://model.crybabyaq.love/?model=audiS8&nobutton"
  title="Audi S8 V8 Engine"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope;"
  style="color-scheme: light;"
/>
```

## TODO üìù

### Features:

- [ ] Supporting the glTF viewer, allowing for the preview of locally uploaded glTF files

- [ ] To enhance individual models, the addition of a ground surface can be incorporated

- [ ] Add a notification to provide an indication when the model file is large in size

- [ ] Display the original author of the model and a Sketchfab link at the top when showcasing the model

### Fix:

- [x] When selecting a model for page navigation, include the existing parameters for a seamless transition.
